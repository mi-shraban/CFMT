# CFMT [Codeforces Managing Tool]
A tool I created and have been using for years to make codeforces problem solving a little painless, with automated file management and template fetching.

## How to use: ##
- Clone this repo to Documents or Desktop or any other directory.
- Press Win + R, type in ```cmd``` and press Enter again.
- Using ```cd Desktop/CMFT``` or ```cd Documents/CFMT``` or ```cd {your_directory}/CFMT``` go inside the folder.
- Write in ```python cfmt.py```
- Next on follow the cli tool's instructions.
- code files will be stored in the ```./CFMT/{your_github_repo}``` directory file.

## Now, I've also built a GUI version ;-;
- Clone this repo OR just [download](https://github.com/mi-shraban/CFMT/releases/tag/v_1.0) the GUI tool.
- Open ```cfmt_gui.exe``` to use it.
- However, the CLI tool is simply bettter ;-;

## Feel free to improve and contribute to the tool. ##
